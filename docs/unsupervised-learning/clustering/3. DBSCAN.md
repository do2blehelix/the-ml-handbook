Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise *(DBSCAN)*
Clusters densely packed points and labels the other points as noise
**Advantages :**No specification of no of clustersFlexibility in shapes and sizes of clustersAble to deal with noise and outliers**Disadvantages :**Border points are assigned to whichever clusters find them firstFaces difficulties in finding clusters of varying densities. *(variation of DBSCAN, HDBSCAN can be used to rectify)*

Epsilon (Îµ) = Search Distance around a pointMinimum number of points = min no of points to be classified as a cluster
**Types of Points:**Noise point : Fails to meet the minimum no of points criteriaCore Point : Meets the minimum no of points criteriaBorder Point : Is in vicinity of core point and contributing to it, but individually fail to meet the criteria min no of pts
Use DBCV (Density Based Cluster Validation) to score DBSCAN. Other validation metrics will mess up the score.
