# Distributions
___

&nbsp;



## Normal / Gaussian / Continuous Distribution
data distributed symmetrically around the centre `skewness = kurtosis = 0`. <br>
_Mean = Median = Mode. Also known as the bell curve._

## Binomial Distribution
Discrete distribution used in statistics. Only counts 2 states typically 0 and 1.

## Uniform** Distribution
Consists of similar values throughout

## Skewed Distribution
Data distributed which spikes towards either ends as opposed to the central spike in normal distribution (skewness: lack of symmetry)

**Kurtosis : pointiness of the curve**
>>Positive kurtosis = leptokurtic | Negative kurtosis = platykurtic

Data dist type | Measure of Central Tendency | Measure of spread (variation)
 :---: | :---: | :---:
Normal | Mean | Standard Deviation
Non normal (skewed) | Median | Range, Percentile & IQR

```
To convert any dataset with any mean & std deviation to a dataset with mean = 0 & std dev = 1.  
Can be done using z-scores: z = (x - x̄) ÷ s
```

### Central Limit Theorem

The distribution of the sample means tends towards a normal distribution as the number of samples increase

-   Take a random population and plot its distribution (assuming distribution ≠ normal distribution)
-   Samples of constant size n are to be taken from the population (n1 = n2 = n3 …)
-   Take a random sample of size n1 from the population and calculate its mean x̄1
-   Take a random sample of size n2 from the population and calculate its mean x̄2
-   Plot the means x̄1, x̄2, x̄3 …
-   The sampling distribution (plot of x̄1, x̄2, x̄3 …) tends to be a normal distribution as the number of samples increases
-   The variance of the sampling distribution = The variance of the population / sample size _σx̄2 = σ2 / n_
-   With a higher value of n, the sampling distribution tends to have a lower variance (high kurtosis), and vice-versa
-   The standard deviation of the sampling means is called Standard Error of the Mean.
