# Unsupervised Learning

In Unsupervised Learning, you have **non labelled data** and are trying to group together similar data points based off of features. No concept of Dependent and Independent Variables


In Unsupervised Learning, the system is not told the ‘right answer’ and the algorithm figures out the relations or attributes.

### Used for:

- Segmenting text topics
- Recommend items
- Identify data outliers
