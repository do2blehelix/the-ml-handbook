# Measures of Central Tendency



## Mean

The sum total of units divided by the number of units. `Average`   
*μ  (population) \| x̄  (sample) \| 1/ni=1nxi*

## Median

The middle / midpoint value in a sorted sequence. `Middle`  
*It divides the data 50(more):50(less).* 

## Mode

The most commonly occurring value `Frequent`   
*Two modes = Bimodal ; Multiple modes = Multimodal*

```
Q) Why do we use mean most times ?
A) It takes all values into consideration. Mode/median ignores.

Q) When do we use median ?
A) It is less prone to outliers as it doesn’t get affected by them.
