# The Important Stuff Everyone Misses!

- **Multivariate Analysis** is nothing but regression

- Logistic regression IS a binomial regression (with logit link), a special case of the Generalized Linear Model. It doesn't classify anything *unless a threshold for the probability is set*. Classification is just its application.
- Stepwise regression is by no means a regression. It's a (flawed) method of variable selection.
- OLS is a method of estimation (among others: GLS, TLS, (RE)ML, PQL, etc.), NOT a regression.
  Ridge, LASSO - it's a method of regularization, NOT a regression.
- There are tens of models for the regression analysis. You mention mainly linear and logistic - it's just the GLM! Learn the others too (link in a comment). STOP with the "17 types of regression every DS should know".BTW, there're 270+ statistical tests. Not just t, chi2 & Wilcoxon
