# Statistics

**Descriptive Statistics** :  Provides statistical information about whole sets of data or populations.

**Inferential Statistics** :  Provides statistical information about a dataset represented by a sample. It does so through a sample of the same population.

### Collected Data types

* Time Series : Data collected over a period of time. (eg: same guy at different age)
* Cross Sectional : Data collected at one point in time. (eg: different guys at one point in time)
* Pooled : Combination of cross sectional and Time series data. (eg: different guys at different age)
* Longitudinal / Panel : Same as pooled

### Data Scale

* **Quantitative**
  * Discrete : Integers
  * Continuous : Real Numbers
* **Categorical**
  * Ordinal scale : Natural order exists (eg. high, medium, low)
  * Nominal scale : No natural order (eg. Names)

### Sampling

* **Simple Random Sample** : Every element in the population has an equal probability of being included in the sample i.e. a sample with no bias.
* **Stratified Sampling** : The population is divided into separate groups called strata. Then a probability sample is drawn from each group.
* **Cluster Sampling** : The total population is divided into clusters and a simple random sample of the groups is selected.
