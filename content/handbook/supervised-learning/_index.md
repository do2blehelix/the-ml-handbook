# Supervised Learning

In Supervised Learning, you have **labelled data** and are trying to predict a label (dependent variable) based on known features (independent variables). **Historical data predicts likely future events**. 
Supervised Learning applies already learned concepts from a training dataset to a test dataset.

### Common Types

* Regression
* Classification

### Learners

* Weak : Model which explains the variance more or less accurately
* Strong : Model which explains the variance accurately
