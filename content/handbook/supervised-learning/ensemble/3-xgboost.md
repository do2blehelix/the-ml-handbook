# XGBoost

XGBoost stands for Xtreme Gradient Boosting. It is a decision-tree-based ensemble Machine Learning algorithm that uses a gradient boosting framework. Can be used to solve regression, classification, ranking, and user-defined prediction problems. XGBoost and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs) are both ensemble tree methods that apply the principle of boosting weak learners (CARTs generally) using the gradient descent architecture. However, XGBoost improves upon the base GBM framework through systems optimization and algorithmic enhancements.
