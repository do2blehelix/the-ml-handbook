# Boosted Aggregating

## Bagging

    from sklearn.ensemble import BaggingClassifier

Bagging is an approach where you take random samples of data, build learning algorithms and take simple means to find bagging probabilities.

Objective is to average noisy and unbiased models to create a model with low variance

### Algorithm

1. **Create Multiple Datasets:**
   1. Sampling is done with replacement on the original data and new datasets are formed.
   2. The new data sets can have a fraction of the columns as well as rows, which are generally hyper-parameters in a bagging model
   3. Taking row and column fractions less than 1 helps in making robust models, less prone to overfitting
2. **Build Multiple Classifiers:**
   1. Classifiers are built on each data set.
   2. Generally the same classifier is modeled on each data set and predictions are made.
3. **Combine Classifiers:**
   1. The predictions of all the classifiers are combined using a mean, median or mode value depending on the problem at hand.
   2. The combined values are generally more robust than a single model.

## Random Forest

    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

Random Forest works as a large collection of decorrelated decision trees and is **based on bagging (boosted aggregating)**.

### Algorithm

1. A random sample is taken from the population with random variables (feature selection)
2. A decision tree is made based on the sample.
3. Multiple samples are taken with replacement (bootstrap sampling)
4. Multiple decision trees are created based on their respective samples.
5. All the decision trees are used to create a ranking of classes.
6. The final model is based on the most number votes for the class. _In case of regression, it takes the average of outputs of different trees._

### Advantages

* Capable of performing both regression and classification
* Performs dimension reduction and handles missing values / outliers effectively.
* Can handle huge number of variables
* Shows Importance of variable
* RF is different from bagging : RF selects a subset of predictors as well. This results in decorrelated trees.

### Disadvantages

* Good at classification but doesnâ€™t provide precise continuous nature predictions for regression
* Black Box - very little control on what the model does. Only model parameters can be tuned.
