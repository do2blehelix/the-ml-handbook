# Types of Regression

#### Simple Linear Regression

It is the simplest form of Linear Regression where there is only **one Dependent Variable** and only **one Independent Variable**. The equation of the regression will simply be that of a straight line (y=mx+c)

#### Multiple Regression / (Multivariate Analysis)

**Multiple Regression is nothing but the most common form of regression which we do on a daily basis**. It has **one Dependent Variable** and **Multiple Independent Variables**. Hence the name. In multiple regression, the equation would be :

#### Polynomial Regression

Polynomial regression is another form of regression in which the maximum power of the independent variable is more than 1. In this regression technique, the best fit line is not a straight line instead it is in the form of a curve.

Quadratic regression, or regression with second order polynomial, is given by the following equation:

Y =Θ1 +Θ2_x +Θ3_x2

Stepwise regression is by no means a regression. It's a (flawed) method of variable selection.
