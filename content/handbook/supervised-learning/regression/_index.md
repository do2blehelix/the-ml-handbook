# Regression

{:toc}

Regression analysis is a statistical process for estimating the relationships among variables.

**Correlation** only measures the strength of a linear relationship, it doesnâ€™t tell anything regarding the relationship.  
**Regression** is used to figure out the relationship itself.

> _Eg: if correlation between Y and X is 0.7 then it says if X increases, 70% of the time Y increases. But regression tells if X increases by 1 unit, by how many units does Y increase._

**Types of Data**

* Cross-sectional : data at a single point in time with multiple variables
* Time Series : data at multiple points in time with a single variable
* Longitudinal / Pooled / Panel : cross sectional time series data

### Common Terms

* **Dependent Variable (Y) :** the field which relies on other variables
* **Independent Variable(s) (X)** **:** the assorted variables which has a direct effect on the dependent variable, whether positive or negative.
* Linear Equation : Simply the a straight line with a formula

  y = mx + c
  y:  
  m: intercept
  x: x co-ordinates
  c: constant (or error)
* **B-coefficient** : if X increases by 1 unit, then Y increases by B-coeff units.
* **Intercept** : Value of predicted Y if both X=0 and Y=0  
  Intercept is the value or baseline, (organic growth)
* **Degrees of freedom** = no of obs - (dimensions of x + dimension of y) = n- (k+1) _\[analogy : 5 hats\]_

**Linear regression** is a minimization function where the model is built to minimize the sum of squared errors whereas **logistic regression** is a maximization function where the model tries to maximize the parameter values of every variable in such a way that it fits very well on the data
