# Measures of Central Tendency

***

Central tendency refers to the definition of a group of numbers by a particular number. 

Generally speaking, it's the most common number or most probable common number among a range of numbers.

If you've ever used the word 'average' in a sentence, eg _On an average the temperature is 25 degrees here_, you are more than familiar with the concept already. 

Below are the top 3 measures of central tendency.

## Mean

The most common and frequently used terminology is the mean or average.

It is defined as the sum total of units divided by the number of units.

#### Advantages

* Mean or average is understood universally
* Mean is easy to calculate

#### Disadvantages

* Mean is prone to outliers.   
  Meaning:  If the range of numbers is highly favored towards a side, then mean  can become biased. _More on that later._

#### Calculation

`Average`

0 | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8

Mean = 4 (20/5)  
_μ  (population) | x̄  (sample) | 1/ni=1nxi_

## Median

A lesser used term in common language, but it has a huge significance in Statistics. Median is the middle / midpoint value in a sorted sequence. `Middle`  
_It divides the data 50(more):50(less)._

## Mode

The most commonly occurring value `Frequent`  
_Two modes = Bimodal ; Multiple modes = Multimodal_

> Q) Why do we use mean most times ?  
> A) It takes all values into consideration. Mode/median ignores

> Q) When do we use median ?  
> A) It is less prone to outliers as it doesn’t get affected by them.

**Nomenclature**

| Population | Sample |
| --- | --- |
| X = set of population elements | x = set of sample elements |
| N = population size | n = sample size |
| μ = population mean | x̄ = sample mean |
| σ = population std dev | s = sample std dev |

**Normal Distribution Data**

| Percentage | μ ± s.d. |
| --- | --- |
| 68.3 % | μ ± 1σ |
| 95.5 % | μ ± 2σ |
| 99.7 % | μ ± 3σ |
