# Measures of Central Tendency

***

Central tendency refers to the definition of a distribution of numbers by a particular central number.

Generally speaking, it's the most common number or most probable common number among a range of numbers.

If you've ever used the word 'average' in a sentence, eg _On an average the temperature is 25 degrees here_, you are more than familiar with the concept already.

Below are the top 3 measures of central tendency.

## Mean

> The Average

The most common and frequently used terminology is the mean or average.

It is defined as the sum total of units divided by the number of units.

#### Advantages

* Mean or average is understood universally
* Mean is easy to calculate
* It takes all values into consideration and doesn't ignore any values.

#### Disadvantages

* Mean is prone to outliers. Since mean doesn't ignore values, if there is a heavy concentration of high/low value numbers, the mean is affected. _More on that later._

#### How To

| 2 | 2 | 4 | 5 | 7 | 9 |

Mean = (2+2+4+5+7+9) / (6) = 5

## Median

> The Midpoint

A lesser used term in common language, but it has a huge significance in Statistics. Median is the middle / midpoint value in a sorted sequence. _It divides the data 50:50._

#### Advantages

* Median is better at handling outliers as it doesn’t get affected by them

#### Disadvantages

* Median ignores all values and considers only one or two values.

#### How To

| 2 | 2 | 4 | 5 | 7 | 9 |

Mean = (4 + 5) / 2 = 4.5

## Mode

> The Frequent

Simply put, mode is the most commonly occurring value.

_Two modes = Bimodal ; Multiple modes = Multimodal_

#### Advantages

* Mode can be used for categorical variables easily.
* It is used for data representation and gives a certain understanding of the nature of the data.

#### Disadvantages

* In statistics, mode can change the underlying nature of data and hence should be used less frequently or with a strong business reason.

#### How To

| 2 | 2 | 4 | 5 | 7 | 9 |
