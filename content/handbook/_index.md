# Welcome to The Machine Learning Handbook!

In the era of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, it's easy to get lost in the technicalities rather than solving business problems.

This handbook is a easy manual to get you started on the path of Machine Learning with easy relatable examples and lucid terminology. I try to keep everything as simple as can be.

Use this handbook as a quick one stop guide to refresh your memory or a quick base for grasping concepts written in clear, lucid and relatable language.
