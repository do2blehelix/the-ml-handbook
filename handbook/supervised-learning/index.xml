Regression analysis is a statistical process for estimating the relationships among variables.
Correlation only measures the strength of a linear relationship, it doesn’t tell anything regarding the relationship.
Regression is used to figure out the relationship itself.
Eg: if correlation between Y and X is 0.7 then it says if X increases, 70% of the time Y increases. But regression tells if X increases by 1 unit, by how many units does Y increase.</description></item><item><title>Classification</title><link>https://do2blehelix.github.io/the-ml-handbook/handbook/supervised-learning/classification/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Oct 2020 06:14:22 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://do2blehelix.github.io/the-ml-handbook/handbook/supervised-learning/classification/</guid><description>﻿# Classification</description></item><item><title>Ensemble Learning</title><link>https://do2blehelix.github.io/the-ml-handbook/handbook/supervised-learning/ensemble/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Apr 2021 18:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://do2blehelix.github.io/the-ml-handbook/handbook/supervised-learning/ensemble/</guid><description>Ensemble Learning Ensemble model combines multiple ‘individual’ (diverse) models together and delivers superior prediction power.
Bagging Bagging is an approach where you take random samples of data, build learning algorithms and take simple means to find bagging probabilities.
Boosting The term ‘Boosting’ refers to a family of algorithms which converts weak learner to strong learners.
Stacking First, we use multiple base classifiers to predict the class. Second, a new learner is used to combine their predictions with the aim of reducing the generalization error.</description></item><item><title>Time Series / Forecasting</title><link>https://do2blehelix.github.io/the-ml-handbook/handbook/supervised-learning/time-series-forecasting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://do2blehelix.github.io/the-ml-handbook/handbook/supervised-learning/time-series-forecasting/</guid><description>Time Series (Forecasting) [Method = Box-Jenkins (B-J)] Components Trend : A long term (relatively smooth) pattern that usually persists for more than one year
Eg : increasing no of flight passengers
Seasonal : Pattern that occurs at regular intervals. [multiple times in a year (least is once a year)]
Eg December sale
Cyclical : Pattern that occurs over a long time, generally continues over a year
Eg : Recession
Random : The component obtained after the above patterns have been extracted.</description></item></channel></rss>
