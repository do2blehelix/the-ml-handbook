Inferential Statistics : Provides statistical information about a dataset represented by a sample. It does so through a sample of the same population.
Collected Data types Time Series : Data collected over a period of time. (eg: same guy at different age) Cross Sectional : Data collected at one point in time. (eg: different guys at one point in time) Pooled : Combination of cross sectional and Time series data.</description></item><item><title>Knowledge Repository</title><link>https://do2blehelix.github.io/the-ml-handbook/handbook/need-to-know/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://do2blehelix.github.io/the-ml-handbook/handbook/need-to-know/</guid><description>The Important Stuff Everyone Misses! Multivariate Analysis is nothing but regression
Logistic regression IS a binomial regression (with logit link), a special case of the Generalized Linear Model. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t classify anything unless a threshold for the probability is set. Classification is just its application.
Stepwise regression is by no means a regression. It&amp;rsquo;s a (flawed) method of variable selection.
OLS is a method of estimation (among others: GLS, TLS, (RE)ML, PQL, etc.</description></item><item><title>NLP</title><link>https://do2blehelix.github.io/the-ml-handbook/handbook/nlp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://do2blehelix.github.io/the-ml-handbook/handbook/nlp/</guid><description>Natural Language Processing NLP can be divided in supervised and unsupervised techniques

Historical data predicts likely future events.
Supervised Learning applies already learned concepts from a training dataset to a test dataset.
Common Types Regression Classification Learners Weak : Model which explains the variance more or less accurately Strong : Model which explains the variance accurately</description></item><item><title>Unsupervised Learning</title><link>https://do2blehelix.github.io/the-ml-handbook/handbook/c-unsupervised-learning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://do2blehelix.github.io/the-ml-handbook/handbook/c-unsupervised-learning/</guid><description>Unsupervised Learning In Unsupervised Learning, you have non labelled data and are trying to group together similar data points based off of features. No concept of Dependent and Independent Variables
In Unsupervised Learning, the system is not told the ‘right answer’ and the algorithm figures out the relations or attributes.
