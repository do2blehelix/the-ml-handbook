It is defined as the square of correlation between Predicted and Actual values.
R2= SSEIndependent VarSSEIndependent Var + SSEErrors
Adjusted R Square: Similar to R2. It penalizes for adding impurity (insignificant variables) to the model
MSE (Mean Squared Error) : Sum of squares / df
RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) : It measures standard deviation of the residuals.</description></item><item><title>Statistics</title><link>https://do2blehelix.github.io/the-ml-handbook/handbook/statistics/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Oct 2020 06:14:22 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://do2blehelix.github.io/the-ml-handbook/handbook/statistics/</guid><description>Statistics Descriptive Statistics : Provides statistical information about whole sets of data or populations.
Inferential Statistics : Provides statistical information about a dataset represented by a sample. It does so through a sample of the same population.
Collected Data types Time Series : Data collected over a period of time. (eg: same guy at different age) Cross Sectional : Data collected at one point in time. (eg: different guys at one point in time) Pooled : Combination of cross sectional and Time series data.</description></item><item><title>☑️ Classification Evaluation Metrics</title><link>https://do2blehelix.github.io/the-ml-handbook/handbook/evaluation/supervised-model-evaluation/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Apr 2021 18:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://do2blehelix.github.io/the-ml-handbook/handbook/evaluation/supervised-model-evaluation/</guid><description>Model Evaluation / Selection / Fits / Validation Train Test Split Before running the model, the data is split into Training and Testing sets. The training to test split ratio is generally 70:30 and can vary. The model is trained on the Training dataset hence the name Once the model is fit on the data, we use the Testing dataset to check how the model performs. The model is best served with a k-fold cross validation set where the data is randomly split multiple k times and each time the model fit is checked.</description></item><item><title>Supervised Learning</title><link>https://do2blehelix.github.io/the-ml-handbook/handbook/supervised-learning/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Oct 2020 06:14:22 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://do2blehelix.github.io/the-ml-handbook/handbook/supervised-learning/</guid><description>Supervised Learning In Supervised Learning, you have labelled data and are trying to predict a label (dependent variable) based on known features (independent variables). Historical data predicts likely future events.
Supervised Learning applies already learned concepts from a training dataset to a test dataset.
Common Types Regression Classification Learners Weak : Model which explains the variance more or less accurately Strong : Model which explains the variance accurately</description></item><item><title>Unsupervised Learning</title><link>https://do2blehelix.github.io/the-ml-handbook/handbook/unsupervised-learning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Apr 2021 18:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://do2blehelix.github.io/the-ml-handbook/handbook/unsupervised-learning/</guid><description>Unsupervised Learning In Unsupervised Learning, you have non labelled data and are trying to group together similar data points based off of features. No concept of Dependent and Independent Variables
In Unsupervised Learning, the system is not told the ‘right answer’ and the algorithm figures out the relations or attributes.

Efficient clusters have similar data huddled together and have clear separation from other clusters.
Compactness : how close the data are to each other (within-cluster-variance)
Separability : how far/distinct clusters are from each other (between-cluster-variance)
Optimum clusters should have similar data clustered together (high compactness) and all clusters as far as possible from each other (high separability)</description></item><item><title>Reinforcement Learning</title><link>https://do2blehelix.github.io/the-ml-handbook/handbook/reinforcement-learning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://do2blehelix.github.io/the-ml-handbook/handbook/reinforcement-learning/</guid><description>Reinforcement Learning</description></item><item><title>NLP</title><link>https://do2blehelix.github.io/the-ml-handbook/handbook/natural-language-processing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://do2blehelix.github.io/the-ml-handbook/handbook/natural-language-processing/</guid><description>Natural Language Processing NLP can be divided in supervised and unsupervised techniques
